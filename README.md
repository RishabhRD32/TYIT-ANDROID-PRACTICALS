## 🚀 How to Perform Practicals (Universal Steps)

Follow these steps for **EVERY practical**:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RishabhRD32/TYIT-ANDROID-PRACTICALS.git
```
OR
Download ZIP → Extract → Open folder


### 2️⃣ Open Practical in Android Studio
1. Open Android Studio
2. Click Open an Existing Project
3. Select the required PracticalX folder
4. Wait for Gradle Sync to complete

⚠️ If prompted:
* Install missing SDK
* Update Gradle plugin
* Click Sync Now

### 3️⃣ Understand the Code Structure
Each practical generally contains:
 *  MainActivity.kt – core logic
 *  AndroidManifest.xml – application configuration
 *  res/layout/*.xml – UI design
 *  res/values/ – colors, strings, themes

📌 Do NOT skip this step — it is important for viva.

### 4️⃣ Run the Application
* Open AVD Manager
* Start an Emulator (Pixel / Nexus recommended)
* Click Run ▶️
OR
* Connect a physical Android device with USB debugging enabled

### 5️⃣ Verify Output
* Observe UI behavior
* Perform required actions (button clicks, navigation, etc.)
* Check Logcat for lifecycle/events (if applicable)
📸 Take screenshots for journal submission.
